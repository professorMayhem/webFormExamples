# webFormExamples
website form examples to support my classes at Montana Technological University

These code examples were compiled from a variety of online sources and modified to illustrate particular aspects 
of forms and php form-handling.

Each folder contains a form, which is plain HTML, and a target page, which contains code to validate or process form
data.  

simpleform - HTML forms with Javascript validation

other folders - PHP, uses POST, connects database and process the data
